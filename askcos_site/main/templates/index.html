<p>
    Welcome to the ASKCOS website! Here, we have hosted a number of computational tools to assist in synthetic
    planning and other aspects of organic chemistry. These are listed and described in the Modules tab in the top
    navigation bar. Please keep in mind that this service is supported by a fixed amount of computational resources.
    Your requests may take significantly longer than expected if there are several other users on the site also
    performing computationally-expensive requests.

    This work began under the DARPA Make-It program (ARO W911NF-16-2-0023) and continues to be supported by the
    <a href="http://mlpds.mit.edu" target="_blank">Machine Learning for Pharmaceutical Discovery and Synthesis
        Consortium</a>. Several of the deployed models are described in publications listed
    <a href="http://mlpds.mit.edu/papers/" target="_blank">here</a>.
